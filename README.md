- [Personae - RL & SL Methods and Envs For Quantitative Trading](https://github.com/Ceruleanacg/Personae)   
  Personae is a repo that implements papers proposed methods in Deep Reinforcement Learning & Supervised Learning and applies them to Financial Market. Now Personae includes 4 RL & 3 SL implements and a simulate Financial Market supporting Stock and Future. More RL & SL methods are updating!

- [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Ceruleanacg/Reinforcement-Learning)   
  This repo is implements of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, implementing as learning, some of them are even another version of some tutorial. Any contributions are welcomed.
